# RFID-based-Cow-Pen-Security-System
RFID security system used for counting cows 

The main sensor in this system is the RFID reader. RFID tags will be attached to a cow necklace, and will be detected by the device later. When a cow is detected entering the cage, the counter will start counting the number of cows.
The number of cattle will be seen on the website that has been created by using Flask as the framework.
